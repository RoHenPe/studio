# **App Name**: Unity Room Connect

## Core Features:

- Room ID Creation: Display a text field for the first player to enter a room ID, acting as the room name. They create a room by entering an ID.
- Room ID Entry: Display a text field for the second player to enter the same room ID to join the created room.

- Shared Game Scene: Transition both players to a shared game scene upon successful connection. Let the scene indicate to the user that both players are connected and can play.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) for a sense of connection and open communication.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to reduce eye strain and provide a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft green (#90EE90) for a positive confirmation when connected.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' for a modern and clean user experience.
- Center the text fields and connection status messages for a clean and straightforward UI.
- Use simple icons for connection status, like a connecting arrow or a green checkmark upon connection.
- Use a subtle loading animation, such as a pulsing circle, during the connection process to provide feedback to the user.
